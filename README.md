Hi guys and welcome to my Vending Machine project!

First of all, this project is made in vanilla JS. I started learning React from our interview, but I didn't have enough time to do the React application. I sincerely tell you that in the next period I will also make this Vending Machine as a React app :) 

Secondly, I want to let you know how my Vending Machine works (PC only).
You need to follow those steps:
1. Open https://sandrusha.github.io/vending-machine/;
2. Enter the amount of money you have for getting some awesome products from the Vendomat;
3. Press OK if / when the amount is the right one;
4. Now you can pressing the numbers from the keypad above the Sum section, along with OK or DEL (if you want to delete the code number);
5. If you need to take your change, please press Change button and the Vending Machine will return your change.
6. You can see under Dev Tool the Stock of the Products;
7. If you are getting the same products until Stock = 0, you can see the unavailablity of that product by changing the image with one of Out Of Stock and also, an error will show up;
8. If you try to get a product which does not exist, you will get an error instead;
9. If the Product costs more then your available amount, you will also get an error.

Thank you for your attention!
